# Human-Action-Recognition-using-Self-Attention-Bidirectional-and-plain-Bidirectional-LSTM-model-
This repo contains the code for my MSc project Human Action Recognition using Self Attention Bidirectional and plain Bidirectional LSTM model 

Platform: Google Colab

Language: Python

DL framework: Keras and tensorflow 

Used Action Recognition datasets: 

.	UCF11

.	UCFSports

.	J-HMDBD


1. The ipynb file CNN_features is used for extracting features from the frames using CNN
2. The ipynb file LSTM_fainl is used for processing the Feature Set using BiLSTM/ Self Attention BiLSTM 
3. The ipynb files  Pipe_Final and Confusion_Matrix are used to predict and print Confusion_Matrix 
the accuracies and confusion matrix for all the models are under the results file
